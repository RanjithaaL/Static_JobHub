# Job Hub ‚Äì Job Listing Application

A modern job listing application built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend), using Firebase for authentication and GitHub OAuth. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the backend is deployed on Render.

## About This Project

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a static job portal. The goal was to validate the concept of a simple, lightweight platform for job listings, before investing in a dynamic or database-driven solution. It demonstrates:

- Basic job listing and filtering functionality
- User-friendly UI
- Rapid development with minimal costs

This MVP was developed to test user engagement and gather feedback for potential future enhancements.
